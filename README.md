# ICS173FinalProject
My ICS 173 Final Project!

This is my final project for my ICS 173 class. This class taught me how to use Python and to utilize
data to create Data Visualization. For example, if I want to highlight specific and important data from a spreadsheet
I can do so by creating a specific graph to emphasize the information to the audience.
